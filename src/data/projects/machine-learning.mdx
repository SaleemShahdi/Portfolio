- Implemented and trained several fundamental machine learning models in Python using the PyTorch framework, addressing a range of problems including binary classification, non-linear regression, and multi-class image classification.
- Utilized PyTorch Tensors as the core data structure to represent all multi-dimensional data, enabling efficient vector and matrix operations for model training and inference without the need for custom-written mathematical code.
- Developed a Perceptron classifier from basic principles to understand linear models, implementing the weight initialization, dot-product scoring, prediction logic, and the iterative training loop that updates weights based on misclassified examples.
- Constructed a multi-layer neural network with ReLU activations using PyTorch's `nn.Linear` layers to solve a non-linear regression task: approximating the `sin(x)` function. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.
- Applied neural network design to a multi-class image classification problem by building and training a model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving over 97% test accuracy. Utilized Cross-Entropy Loss and monitored validation accuracy to guide the training process.
