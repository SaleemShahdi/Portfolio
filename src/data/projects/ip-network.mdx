- Individually configured a complete IP network from scratch within a Mininet virtualized environment, demonstrating a practical understanding of network setup, routing, and troubleshooting. The final topology consisted of four hosts and a central router with full end-to-end connectivity.
- Overcame significant environmental challenges by systematically troubleshooting and resolving complex SSH and file-sharing issues between the host OS and the Mininet virtual machine. This involved diagnosing problems with the minimal VM installation and successfully configuring a NAT network adapter with port forwarding to establish a stable connection for development and testing.
- Utilized the `ip addr add` command to manually assign specific IP addresses to all 8 virtual network interfaces across the four hosts and the router, creating two distinct subnets within the virtualized environment.
- Engineered the network's routing logic using the `ip route add` command, which included setting a default gateway on each host and programming the router's forwarding table with specific routes to enable full communication between all nodes.
- Verified the complete network configuration and end-to-end connectivity using standard Linux networking utilities, performing successful `ping` and `traceroute` tests between all host pairs to confirm that the routing logic was implemented correctly.
