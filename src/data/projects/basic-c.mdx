- Developed a command-line utility in C to perform statistical analysis on data from CSV files, demonstrating foundational C programming skills, including file I/O, string parsing, and dynamic memory allocation.
- Implemented logic to read a CSV file of up to 100x100 dimensions, parse its comma-delimited contents using `strtok`, and store the data in a dynamically allocated 2D integer array (`malloc`).
- Wrote functions to calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum of a specified row or column from the parsed data, based on user input provided via command-line arguments (`argv`).
- Implemented robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as non-existent files or out-of-bounds row/column indices, ensuring the program exits gracefully with an appropriate status code and error message.
- Conducted all development and compilation remotely on a Linux server, using `gcc` and a `makefile` to manage the build process in a standard Unix environment.
