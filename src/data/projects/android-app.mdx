- Collaborated in a two-person team to port a feature-rich desktop photo application to a native Android app using Java and Android Studio, applying the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
- Designed and built a complete, single-user mobile UI using Android XML layouts, handling screen navigation between multiple Activities and user interactions to support full album and photo management.
- Reused and adapted the existing object model for albums, photos, and tags, and managed data persistence by serializing the object graph to the device's local storage.
- Engineered an advanced search feature allowing users to find photos across all albums by tag-value pairs, with support for conjunctive (AND) and disjunctive (OR) queries, as well as auto-completion for partial text matches.
- Advanced team collaboration skills by managing a shared codebase in a new development environment, using Git and GitHub to coordinate the integration of the Java backend logic with the Android-specific UI and build system (Gradle).
