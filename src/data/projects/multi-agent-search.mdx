- Designed and implemented several AI agents to play Pacman by applying adversarial search algorithms, enabling decision-making in a dynamic, multi-agent environment with competing goals between Pacman and the ghosts.
- Implemented the recursive Minimax algorithm to find the optimal move by exploring the game tree, assuming an optimal ghost adversary. Subsequently optimized this search by implementing Alpha-Beta Pruning, which significantly reduced the number of explored states by pruning subtrees that could not influence the final decision.
- Developed an Expectimax agent to model and play against non-optimal, probabilistic ghosts. This involved replacing MIN nodes in the game tree with chance nodes that calculate the expected value of ghost moves, leading to more practical, risk-tolerant agent behavior compared to the pessimistic Minimax approach.
- Engineered a sophisticated heuristic evaluation function to score non-terminal game states. The function incorporated various features, such as distance to the nearest food, ghost positions, and scared ghost timers, to effectively guide the search agents toward high-scoring and winning states.
