- Developed a C program to predict house prices by analyzing historical data on specific attributes (e.g., number of bedrooms, square footage), implementing a predictive model based on the one-shot learning paradigm. This project served as an introduction to fundamental Machine Learning (ML) concepts, providing practical experience with the core linear algebra that powers many modern AI applications—such as recommendation systems and data-driven forecasting—by deriving a predictive weight matrix from a training dataset.
- Implemented the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm from scratch to compute a matrix inverse, performing sequential row operations to transform a target matrix into an identity matrix while simultaneously applying the same operations to an initial identity matrix to produce its inverse.
- Developed a suite of modular matrix manipulation functions (transpose, multiply, invert) to solve for the weight matrix $W$ using the normal equation: $W=(X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$.
- Managed a complex data pipeline by parsing floating-point data (double) from two separate input files, and meticulously allocating and deallocating memory for nine distinct 2D matrices using `malloc` and `free` to store inputs, intermediate products, and final results without memory leaks.
- Conducted all development remotely on a university-provided Linux server, utilizing the command-line toolchain (GCC, Makefiles) for all compilation, execution, and testing in a standard Unix environment.
