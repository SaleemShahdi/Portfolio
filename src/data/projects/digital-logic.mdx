- Developed a digital logic simulator in C that processes a sequence of dependent logical operations from a custom circuit description file. The program models the circuit as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in memory and generates a complete truth table by simulating the circuit's output for every possible input combination.
- Solved the advanced challenge of out-of-order circuit descriptions by modeling the circuit as a dependency graph and implementing Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. This is a crucial skill directly applicable to other real-world dependency-resolution problems like software build systems, project task scheduling, and academic course planning.
- Designed a flexible data model to represent a variety of logic gates, including standard gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) and complex, variable-sized components like n-to-2^n DECODERs and 2^n-to-1 MULTIPLEXERs.
- Created a robust parser using `fscanf` to read the token-based language, mapping symbolic variable names to integer IDs for efficient processing, and meticulously managed memory for all dynamically allocated data structures.
- Conducted all development remotely on a university-provided Linux server, utilizing the command-line toolchain (GCC, Makefiles) for all compilation, execution, and testing in a standard Unix environment.
