- Developed a series of pathfinding agents for a Pacman AI project, implementing a comprehensive suite of classical Artificial Intelligence search algorithms in Python to solve various maze navigation and optimization problems.
- Implemented both uninformed search algorithms (Depth-First, Breadth-First) and informed, heuristic-driven algorithms (Uniform-Cost, A* Search), correctly using different data structures (Stack, Queue, Priority Queue) to manage the search frontier for each.
- Designed custom search problems with complex state representations, such as the "Corners Problem" where the state tracked the set of visited corners, demonstrating the ability to abstract challenges into a formal state-space search framework.
- Engineered a custom, non-trivial heuristic for the "Corners Problem" to aggressively guide the A* search algorithm, demonstrating an understanding of how heuristics are used to prune the state space and find solutions more quickly.
- Applied these search concepts to solve a traveling salesman-style "Food Search Problem", which involved working with a more complex state space and designing an additional custom heuristic to find a path visiting all food dots.
