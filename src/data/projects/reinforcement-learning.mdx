- Implemented several fundamental Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in Python to train autonomous agents capable of learning optimal policies in environments with stochastic outcomes, such as Gridworld, a crawler robot, and Pacman.
- Developed a model-based planning agent using Value Iteration, an algorithm that repeatedly applies the Bellman update to iteratively compute the optimal value function V*(s) for all states, given a known Markov Decision Process (MDP).
- Built a model-free agent using Q-Learning, which learns the optimal action-value function Q*(s,a) directly from environmental interactions, and implemented an epsilon-greedy policy to manage the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
- Solved the challenge of large state spaces by implementing Approximate Q-Learning, which replaced the Q-table with a learned weight vector over features to allow the agent to generalize value estimates across similar states.
- Analyzed the impact of MDP parameters (discount factor, noise, living reward) on agent behavior, determining the specific hyperparameters required to produce a range of distinct optimal policies, from risk-seeking to risk-averse.
