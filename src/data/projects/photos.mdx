- Collaborated in a two-person team to develop a feature-rich photo management desktop application in Java, utilizing a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to cleanly separate the data model, UI, and application logic.
- Constructed a complete Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX, with all custom views designed declaratively in FXML. The UI supported a multi-user system with an admin panel, full album and photo management, and a detailed photo view with metadata.
- Designed and implemented a comprehensive object model for users, albums, photos, and customizable key-value tags. Handled all data persistence by implementing Java Serialization to save and load the entire user-specific object graph to and from disk.
- Engineered a robust search engine that allowed users to find photos by date range or by complex tag queries, including support for conjunctive (AND) and disjunctive (OR) logical operations.
- Managed the project's development lifecycle and collaborated with a partner using Git and GitHub, practicing incremental commits and version control in a team setting.
