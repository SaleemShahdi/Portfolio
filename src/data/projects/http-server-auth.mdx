- Built the core application logic for an HTTP server in Python, extending a starter framework to handle GET and POST requests, parse HTTP headers, and manage user authentication through both password-based login and persistent cookie-based sessions.
- Designed and implemented a dedicated `Database` class to encapsulate all user data management, reading credentials and secrets from text files into an in-memory dictionary. This modular design simplified the main server logic and improved code organization.
- Implemented the server's logic to parse raw HTTP POST request bodies to extract username and password credentials. Authenticated users against the `Database` object and served protected content upon success, or an error page upon failure.
- Engineered a full cookie-based session management system. Upon successful login, the server generated a unique 64-bit random token, sent it to the client via a `Set-Cookie` header, and stored it in an in-memory dictionary to validate future requests.
- Created a logout functionality that correctly cleared the client's session by sending back a `Set-Cookie` header with an expiry date in the past, effectively invalidating the session token.
