- [cite_start]**Rot13:** A lightweight command-line utility that performs a Rot-13 substitution cipher on a string, demonstrating foundational C programming and character manipulation[cite: 158]. [cite_start]Processed command-line arguments and implemented case-sensitive cipher logic using ASCII ranges[cite: 160].
- [cite_start]**sorta:** A command-line utility that sorts string arguments using an efficient, in-place Insertion Sort algorithm[cite: 162]. [cite_start]Utilized `strcmp()` for case-sensitive lexicographical ordering and robustly handled a variable number of arguments[cite: 164, 165].
- [cite_start]**balance:** A command-line tool that validates the correct nesting of delimiters using a custom-implemented stack and manual memory management[cite: 166]. [cite_start]Engineered comprehensive error-handling to identify mismatched, unexpected, and unclosed delimiters[cite: 168].
- [cite_start]**list:** An interactive C program that implements a sorted doubly linked list to dynamically manage integers, showcasing advanced pointer manipulation[cite: 171]. [cite_start]Constructed the data structure from scratch and engineered insertion/deletion logic to maintain numerical order[cite: 172, 173].
- [cite_start]**mexp:** A command-line utility that calculates matrix exponentiation (M^n) by implementing a recursive algorithm and a sophisticated memory management strategy[cite: 177, 179]. [cite_start]Managed the complete file I/O lifecycle and dynamically allocated 2D arrays with `malloc`[cite: 180, 181].
- [cite_start]**bst:** A comprehensive program that implements a complete Binary Search Tree from scratch, supporting full CRUD operations driven by recursive functions[cite: 182]. [cite_start]Engineered a complex delete function to handle all three node-removal scenarios and demonstrated meticulous memory management[cite: 184, 187].
