---
- **Rot13:** A lightweight command-line utility that performs a Rot-13 substitution cipher on a string, demonstrating foundational C programming and character manipulation. Processed command-line arguments and implemented case-sensitive cipher logic using ASCII ranges.
---
- **sorta:** A command-line utility that sorts string arguments using an efficient, in-place Insertion Sort algorithm. Utilized `strcmp()` for case-sensitive lexicographical ordering and robustly handled a variable number of arguments.
---
- **balance:** A command-line tool that validates the correct nesting of delimiters using a custom-implemented stack and manual memory management. Engineered comprehensive error-handling to identify mismatched, unexpected, and unclosed delimiters.
---
- **list:** An interactive C program that implements a sorted doubly linked list to dynamically manage integers, showcasing advanced pointer manipulation. Constructed the data structure from scratch and engineered insertion/deletion logic to maintain numerical order.
---
- **mexp:** A command-line utility that calculates matrix exponentiation (M^n) by implementing a recursive algorithm and a sophisticated memory management strategy. Managed the complete file I/O lifecycle and dynamically allocated 2D arrays with `malloc`.
---
- **bst:** A comprehensive program that implements a complete Binary Search Tree from scratch, supporting full CRUD operations driven by recursive functions. Engineered a complex delete function to handle all three node-removal scenarios and demonstrated meticulous memory management.
