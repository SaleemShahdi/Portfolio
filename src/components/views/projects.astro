        <p>
          My approach to software engineering is driven by a passion for continuous learning. I believe a developer's true value lies not in the tools they already know, but in their ability to master the <em>next</em> tool required to solve a new challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects below are a chronicle of this philosophy in action. They showcase my journey across different programming paradigms and problem domainsâ€”from the low-level memory management of <strong>C</strong>, to the high-level data processing of <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, to the robust object-oriented architecture of <strong>Java</strong>. Each technology listed is evidence of a new concept learned and a new problem solved.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can explore these projects to see the technologies I've mastered, while I am always expanding my technological horizons.
