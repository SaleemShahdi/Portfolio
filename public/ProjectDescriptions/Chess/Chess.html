<hr>
<p>For this assignment you will explore how to apply the object-oriented
design ideas you learned in class to design and implement the chess game.
<br><font color="red">You will work on this assignment in pairs.</font>
Make sure you abide by the 
<a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy/programming-assignments">
DCS Academic Integrity Policy for Programmming Assignments</a>.

</p><p>We will ONLY grade assignments submitted to Autolab. Assignments emailed to the 
instructor/TAs/graders will be ignored--they will NOT be accepted for grading. 
Also, any assignment on your computer, or any other online space (GitHub repo, etc.), 
will NOT be accepted for grading.

</p><p>Your submission will be <b>autograded</b> so be careful to follow implementation
instructions (and constraints) exactly as detailed. There will NOT be any manual
inspection of your code, nor will be there any manual inspection of anything
your code might print. All credit is solely for structures that are 
returned from methods that are called on your program by the autograder and 
checked by the autograder against the expect correct structures.

</p><p>See the <b>Grading Process</b> section at the end of this page to see how Autolab 
will be set up to grade your assignment. This may be different than how Autolab is
setup in CS 111 and CS 112.

</p><p><b><font color="red">IMPORTANT: Autolab uses Java 21, so make sure your program will
compile and run with Java 21.</font></b>
  
</p><p>

<hr>

You will implement the game
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> for two
players.  Your program, when launched, should draw the board
<font color="red">in text, on the terminal</font> and prompt
whomever's turn it is (white or black) for a move. Once the move is
executed, the move should be played and the new board drawn, and the
other player queried.

<hr>

<p></p><h3><a name="board"></a>Board</h3>

<p>
The figure below depicts a chess board. Every square on the board is 
identified in the form of <b>FileRank</b> where the File is a column from a thru h,
and the Rank is a row from 1 to 8. So, for instance, the square g5 is in column
g, row 5.

</p><p>The white pieces always intially occupy ranks 1 and 2. The black pieces always 
initially occupy ranks 7 and 8. The queen always starts on the d file.
</p>
<img src="./ChessFiles/SCD_algebraic_notation.svg">

<hr>
<h3><a name="move"></a>Move</h3>

<p><font color="red">A game must always start with a move by the player who is 
playing white.</font>

</p><p>A piece is moved from one square to another using the notation 
<b>FileRank</b> <b>FileRank</b>,
so for example, when the game starts, the move <stt>"e2 e4"</stt> would move the 
white pawn from e2 to e4.

</p><p>Here's a sample sequence of alterating white and black moves:
</p><pre>e2 e4
g8 h6
f1 c4
c7 c5
</pre>

<h4><em>Special Move Formats</em></h4>

The following moves require a special reading of the format:
<ul>
<li><em><b>Castling</b></em><p>

A castling move is indicated by specifying where the king begins and ends.
So, white castling king's side would be "e1 g1".
</p><p></p></li><li><em><b>Pawn promotion</b></em><p>

A pawn promotion is indicated by putting the piece to be promoted to after the move. 
So, promoting a pawn to a knight might be "g7 g8 N". (Rook is R, bishop is B).
If no promotion piece is  indicated, it is assumed to be a queen. (Although you
can explicitly ask for a queen promotion, as in "g7 g8 Q", it is discouraged.)

</p><p></p></li><li><em><b>Resign</b></em><p>

A player may resign by simply issuing the move "resign". Here's an example of a sequence
of moves that ends with white resigning:
</p><pre>e2 e4
e7 e5
resign
</pre>

<p></p></li><li><em><b>Draw</b></em><p>

A player may ask for a draw like this:
</p><pre>e2 e4
e7 e5
g1 f3 draw?
</pre>
Unlike "resign" which is a move all by itself, a draw is asked for 
by appending "draw?" to an otherwise regular move. Consequently, the move 
is first carried out, and then the draw is applied.
</li></ul>
<p>

</p><h4><em>Illegal Moves</em></h4>

<ul>
<li>Every piece must know what moves are allowed on it. If a player attempts an
illegal move on a piece, the move should not be executed. 

<p></p></li><li>A piece cannot be moved in a way that would immediately put that
player's king under check by the opponent:
<pre>g2 g3
e7 e6
g1 h3
f8 b4
<font color="red">d2 d3</font>
</pre>
The white move "d2 d3" would put the white king in check from the black bishop.
So it is an illegal move that should not be allowed.

<p><font color="red">Note that when a player makes an illegal move, it's still their 
turn until they make a legal move.</font>
</p></li></ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="end"></a>Ending the game</h3>
The game may end in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<p></p><li><em><b>Checkmate</b></em><p>

The player that applies the checkmate wins.

</p><p></p></li><li><em><b>Resign</b></em><p>

A player may resign as described in the previous section. The other player wins.

</p><p></p></li><li><em><b>Draw</b></em><p>

A player may offer a draw as descried in the previous section.

</p><p>For the purpose of this assignment, the other player is <b>obligated</b> to accept
the draw, even if the player who proposes a draw might be in a losing position.<br>

</p><p>Note: There will be no automatic draws (due to unchangeing positions over 
long periods of time, etc).

</p><p><font color="red">You are NOT required to implement termination by threefold repetition, or 
the fifty-move rule</font>. (You are welcome to include them in your code to make it complete;
however, there is no extra credit for either.)
</p></li></ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="impl"></a>Implementation</h3>

<p>You will implement your code in as many classes as you would like, with
the following <font color="red"><b>constraints</b></font>:
</p><ol>
<li>All your classes must be in a package named <tt>chess</tt>. Otherwise
we will not be able to grade your program.
<p></p></li><li>One of the classes you must implement is the supplied <tt>Chess</tt> class
in <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/213/classes/fall_2025_venugopal/chess/Chess.java">Chess.java</a>, which is in the <tt>chess</tt> package.
<br>(See the line at the top of the file that says <tt>package chess</tt>).

<p>In <tt>Chess.java</tt>, you will fill in the code for the <tt>start</tt> 
and <tt>play</tt> methods. The autograder will ONLY call these methods.

</p><ul>
<p></p><li>The <tt>Chess</tt> class <tt>play</tt> method returns
a <tt>chess.ReturnPlay</tt> object, defined in
<a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/213/classes/fall_2025_venugopal/chess/ReturnPlay.java">ReturnPlay.java</a><p>
</p><p></p></li><li>The <tt>ReturnPlay</tt> class in turn refers to the 
<tt>chess.ReturnPiece</tt> class,
which is defined in <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/213/classes/fall_2025_venugopal/chess/ReturnPiece.java">ReturnPiece.java</a><p>
</p></li></ul>

<p></p></li><li>You will NOT write a <tt>main</tt> method in any of your classes. <br>
Instead,
you may use the supplied <tt>chess.PlayChess</tt> application
in <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/213/classes/fall_2025_venugopal/chess/PlayChess.java">PlayChess.java</a>

<p>This class has a <tt>main</tt> method that you can use
to test your implementation.

</p><p></p></li><li><font color="red"><b>Do NOT delete or modify any of the original contents 
of</b></font> <tt>Chess.java</tt>:
<ul>
<li>Do NOT change the <tt>enum Player</tt> in ANY way.
</li><li>Do NOT change the headers of the <tt>play</tt> and <tt>start</tt> methods
in ANY way.
</li></ul>
<p></p></li><li><font color="red"><b>Do NOT change the</b></font> <tt>ReturnPiece</tt>
<font color="red"><b>and</b></font>
<tt>ReturnPlay</tt> <font color="red"><b>classes in ANY way</b></font>

<p>NOTE: If your submission includes <tt>ReturnPiece</tt> or
<tt>ReturnPlay</tt>, they will be deleted and replaced by the original
versions before grading.

</p><p></p></li><li>You may add fields and methods to the <tt>Chess</tt> class as
needed. 
<p></p></li><li>You may also add imports to <tt>Chess.java</tt>, as long as
they are from the standard Java SDK (not an external vendor).
</li></ol>
<font color="red"><b>Breaking any of these constraints will make your
submission ungradable, and you will waste a submission.
</b></font>

<h4>If you don't know how to make a package named chess and place the
given Java files in it, use ChatGPT or any other
online resource to find out. You are responsible for figuring this out
and doing it correctly in your development environment.</h4>

<h4>Development Environment</h4>

<p>You may use any Java development environment you are comfortable with,
such as VSCode, Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, etc. Since you will be
submitting only source code in the standard Java package structure,
what environment you use is not of any consequence to the submission.

</p><p>Howeever, whatever environment
you choose, <b>you are fully responsible for knowing how to use it</b> to
develop Java applications.
This assignment and other assignments in this
class may require you to broaden your knowledge in this regard, so you
might need to learn how to do certain things yourself by looking up
resources online. 

</p><p>We all use different environments in general, so 
if you run into trouble with yours, there is no guarantee that we
can help you because we may have never used your environment to build
Java applications.

</p><h4>Returning a result from the <tt>Chess.play</tt> method</h4>

<ul>
The classes <tt>ReturnPiece</tt> and <tt>ReturnPlay</tt>
are specifically set up to return the result of executing
the <tt>Chess.play</tt> method. 

<p><tt>ReturnPiece</tt> encapsulates a piece on the board, and <tt>ReturnPlay</tt>
encapsulates the collection of all pieces on the board, plus a message that
could be null, or could be one of the messages in the <tt>Message</tt> enumeration.

</p><p>The following table gives examples of all scenarios for 
different return values when <tt>Chess.play</tt> is executed on a move.

</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Return</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
Legal move <em>not</em><br>
resulting in a check
</td>
<td>
<tt>ReturnPlay</tt> instance with pieces on board after move is executed,<br>null message

<td>
<tt>ReturnPlay</tt> instance with pieces on board after move is executed<br>
(e.g. in "e2 e4 draw?", the move "e2 e4" is executed before draw)<br>message is <tt>DRAW</tt>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td>
<td>
<tt>ReturnPlay</tt> instance with pieces on board same as previous state of the
board<br>(since move is not executed)<br>
message is <tt>RESIGN_BLACK_WINS</tt> (if white resigned)
or <tt>RESIGN_WHITE_WINS</tt> (if black resigns)
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p></ul>

<h4>Restarting the game from scratch</h4>

<p>The <tt>Chess.start</tt> is to be called any time you want to start/restart the game
from scratch. This is useful to try a sequence of moves, then reset with <tt>start</tt>
for a new sequence from scratch.<br>

</p><p><font color="red">IMPORTANT: When we test your submission, the AUTOGRADER
will execute several games from scratch. Every time it executes a new game, 
it will first call your <tt>Chess.start()</tt> method (which should 
reset the games to the starting start), and then execute moves.</font><br>

</p><p>See the sample run in the next section for an illustration.


</p><hr>

<h4>The <tt>PlayChess</tt> application</h4>

<ul>
You can use this application to test your implementation, by making calls to 
<tt>Chess.start</tt> and <tt>Chess.play</tt>

</ul>
In this second run, the very first move ("e8 e6") is not allowed because it is supposed
to be a white move, which can't move a black pawn. Also, note that when an illegal
move is made, it's still the same player's turn until they make a legal move.

<p><font color="red">The <tt>Chess.start</tt> method is crucial to the autograder
so make sure you implement it correctly, and test it out to see if it sets up
the game to start from scratch as required. This way you (and the autograder)
can play multiple games in a single run of the program.</font>

</p><h4>Important:</h4>

<ul>
Read the code in <tt>PlayChess</tt> and see how it calls the <tt>Chess.play</tt> and
<tt>Chess.start</tt> methods. The autograder will make similar calls to both
methods.

<p>The <tt>PlayChess</tt> application prints the message and board off the 
returned <tt>ReturnPlay</tt> object - this is ONLY for your convenience, so you
can see a visual of the board for testing.

</p><p>The autograder will NOT print the board.
Instead it will compare the structure of the returned <tt>ReturnPlay</tt> object
with the expected structure. <b>If the structures don't match, you will not get credit
for the corresponding move. </b> 

</p><p><font color="red"><b>Make sure to compile and test your code with <tt>PlayChess</tt>. 
If you compile your code without including <tt>PlayChess</tt>, your code is not
guaranteed to work for the autograder and you will waste a submission.</b></font>

</p><p>You will NOT submit <tt>PlayChess.java</tt>, it is only for your testing
purposes. (You don't want to write any actual implementation of the chess
game in this file.) If you submit <tt>PlayChess.java</tt>,
the autograder
will delete it and replace it with the original version of <tt>PlayChess.java</tt>
before grading.

</p><p>You will NOT submit <tt>ReturnPiece</tt> or
<tt>ReturnPlay</tt>. If you do, the autograder will delete them,
and replace them with the original versions before grading.

<h3><a name="submit"></a>Submission</h3>

<p>Make sure to write your name as well as that of your partner in a comment line
at the top of the <tt>Chess.java</tt> file. You don't need to write your names
in any other you may have in your application.

</p><p>You will zip up all the your <b>source</b> (.java) files, except
<tt>PlayChess.java</tt>, <tt>ReturnPlay.java</tt>, and <tt>ReturnPiece.java</tt>, 
into a submission file
named <tt>chess.zip</tt>. (Do not include binary .class files.) Make sure you maintain the directory structure when
you zip the files. This is because when you create a package, an equivalent
folder is made on the filesystem, and all files in a package go under that 
folder. Since there is only one package, <tt>chess</tt>, your zip file 
should have a folder names <tt>chess</tt> that contains all the source Java files. 

</p><p><b><font color="red">CAUTION:</font></b> If your zip file includes
<tt>PlayChess.java</tt>, <tt>ReturnPlay.java</tt>, or <tt>ReturnPiece.java</tt>, 
<b>they will be deleted and replaced with the original versions before 
grading.</b>

</p><p>Make sure to verify that you have zipped correctly by unzipping 
the <tt>chess.zip</tt> file you made, and confirming that it creates a folder
named <tt>chess</tt> under which it places all the contained Java files.
<b>If you don't have the correct structure for the zip file, your program
will not compile and you will waste a submission</b>

</p><p>Submit <tt>chess.zip</tt> to Autolab.

</p><p><b>If you don't know how to zip all your Java source files under the package
<tt>chess</tt>, use ChatGPT or any other
online resource to find out. You are responsible for figuring this out
and doing it correctly in your development environment.</b>

</p><p><b>IMPORTANT:</b>
</p><ul>
<li>Either partner can submit to Autolab
</li><li>When you submit to Autolab, the submission is also counted toward
your partner
</li><li>When you submit, the number of remaining submissions is decreased by 1 for both
you and your partner
</li><li>The grade report for the submission will be the same for you and your
partner

<h3><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<b>Q:</b> Can we assume that all moves sent as parameter to the <tt>Chess.play</tt>
method will be syntactically correct?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes. All inputs will have legit file and rank, will have
exactly one space between
components, such as "e2 e4", or "g7 g7 N". There may be leading or trailing
spaces around the whole move, so you will need to handle that.

<p><b>Q:</b>Do we have to implement a rule where a player is not allowed to make an
otherwise valid move if it will immediately put their king in check?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes. This qualifies as an illegal move.

</p><p><b>Q:</b>We saw rules elsewhere on castling/dead position/what-have-you that 
go beyond the description on the linked Wikipedia page. Should we implement those?<br>
<b>A:</b> No, we are going with the Wikipedia page only. 
We are not all practiced Chess players.

</p><p><b>Q:</b>Will I get any credit if the <tt>ReturnPlay</tt> object returned by
<tt>Chess.play</tt> is incorrect, but I can show that the board is printed
correctly?<br>
<b>A:</b>No, you will not get any credit. The autograder checks the value of
the <tt>ReturnPlay</tt> object on each move, and if it is incorrect, you will
not get any credit. There is no manual inspection of anything that may be
printed by your program.

</p><p><b>Q:</b>I coded a bunch of print statements in my program for testing, 
but forgot to delete them before submitting. Will this mess up the grading?<br>
<b>A:</b>No, it will not mess up the grading. Anything printed by your
program will be ignored.

</p><p><b>Q:</b>Can I add code to the <tt>PlayChess.java</tt> file?<br>
<b>A:</b>Yes, you may. Since you will not be submitting <tt>PlayChess.java</tt>,
you may add code to it to help with your testing. But make sure you don't
add any actual game logic in this file. Also make sure you don't change
the way it calls <tt>Chess.play</tt> and <tt>Chess.start</tt> since the calls
are written to exactly match the requirements of the method headers for
<tt>play</tt> and <tt>start</tt>.
