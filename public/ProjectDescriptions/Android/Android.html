<h2>Port the JavaFX Photos project to Android</h2>

<hr>
You will continue working in pairs. 

<p>Note the following important points:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>You must use GitHub to manage your code repository.

<p></p></li><li>You must use Android Studio only to build your app, and
you must use Java only (not Kotlin).<br>

<p></p></li><li>Your app must run correctly on any device emulator that is in Android
studio with the specification of 1080 x 2400 420 dpi (for example, Pixel 6 or
Medium Phone), using API 36. For the build configuration use the 
Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts) that shows up as the default option in the
Android Studio project creation wizard.


<p></p></li><li>You may serialize the data used in your app,
but are not required to do so - you can use alternative formats for storage on the
device. 

<p></p></li><li>Javadoc is NOT required.

<p></p></li><li>Lateness penalties same as for Photos.<br>
5-point penalty for read access to repository not given to grader by the due date.

<p><b></b></p></li><li><b>You may use ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, or Google Gemini
(which comes with Android Studio), or any combination of these GenAI chatbots,
to help write your code.</b>
However, this comes with the following constraints:
<p></p><ul>
<li>You may NOT do "vibe coding", where you issue a single prompt and the GenAI builds
the entire app
<p></p></li><li>Instead, you need to give a sequence of prompts (and refinements as needed)
to the GenAI for each functional part or use case of the 
app. This will produce code for one functional component (combination
of layouts, values, data files, and Java code) at a time, and you will glue these
functional components together to build the complete app (like how it is being 
done for the apps covered in class)
</li></ul>
<p>If you use GenAI, 
you are required to add a README file to your repository that explains how you
used GenAI: what prompts you issued, what UI drawings you uploaded to
the chatbot, which of the code components
were generated by the AI, which code components you wrote yourself. 
This README is not graded, it is solely for our understanding of how GenAI is used
by students for coding. 
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
Port the FX-based photos project to Android. You may reuse any of the
code from your Java FX project.
</p>

<p>
Since the app will run on a personal smart phone, there is only a single user, who is the 
owner of the phone. So there is no logging in, and no admin functionality. Also, 
explicit captions are
not required for photos (the filename will stand for the caption). 
Dates are not required either.
</p>
<p>
    
</p>

<h4>Your app should implement the following features:</h4>

<ul>
<p></p><li><span class="pts">15 pts</span> Home screen. When the app comes up, it should load album and photo
data from the previous session, if any, and list all albums with names in
plain text.
Off this "home" screen, you should be able to do the following, in one or more navigational
steps.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">25 pts</span>  Open, create, delete, and rename albums as listed in the 
Java FX project description. When opening an album, display all its photos, with 
their thumbnail images.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">25 pts</span>  Once an album is open, you should be able to 
add, remove, or display a photo.
The photo display screen should include an option for a slideshow,
allowing you to go backward or forward in the album one photo at a time with
manual controls.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">15 pts</span>  When a photo is displayed,
you should be able to add a tag to a photo.
Only person and location are valid tag types, 
users may NOT define their own new tag types.
You should also be able to delete a tag from a photo.
Note: When displaying a photo, tags (if any) should be visible.
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">10 pts</span>  You should be able to move a photo from one album to another
<p></p>
<p></p></li><li><span class="pts">30 pts</span> You should be able to
search for photos by tag-value pairs, just like in the Photos
assignment (of course now limited to only person and location type tags). 
All matches are case insensitive, so "new york" is the same as "nEw YOrk".
You need to implement conjunction and disjunction as well.

<p>In addition, matches should now allow <b>auto completion</b>,
given a <em>starting</em> substring. 
For instance, when searching by location, if "New" is typed, 
matches should
include photos taken in New York, New Mexico, New Zealand, etc. In other words,
all locations that start with the typed text. The user can then pick from this
auto-completed list.

</p><p>Searches apply to photos across all albums, not just to the album that may be open.

</p><p>Note: You are NOT required to implement functionality to add new tag types,
or save the matching photos in an album.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You may save photos to the device's gallery. Here's some info on how
to access files (including photos) from storage:

<h3><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><b>Q: </b>
Are there any particular requirements for the android port as long as the 
project satisfies the functionality that is listed in the project description? 
For instance, should we have a certain project structure, should we be using 
specific UI elements, etc.?
<br><b>A: </b>No specific project structure or UI requirements.

</p><p><b>Q: </b>
Do we have to use XML or FXML to format our android program, or can we do it 
natively in JavaFX? 
<br><b>A: </b>You may only use Android XML (with Android tag namespace), not FXML.
Also, you are required to build all your UI with XML, except for error/info
dialogs where user action is limited to clicking a button for OK/Cancel/Yes/No type
of thing. 

</p><p><b>Q: </b>What happens if a photo is removed from the gallery after being 
added to an album, should we handle this kind of issue?
<br><b>A: </b>No, you don't need to handle this.

</p><p><b>Q: </b>Is the stock photo functionality required?
<br><b>A: </b>No.

</p><p><b>Q: </b>
When we implement searching photos by tag, should we display all photos that satisfy 
it in general or only the photos that satisfy it in the particular album that is open?
<br><b>A: </b>Photos from <b>all</b> albums, not just the ones in the open album.

</p><p><b>Q: </b>
If we tag image1 with tag1 in album1, and image1 is in album2 as well, 
should we update the tags for image 1 in album2?
<br><b>A: </b>Since there is no functionality to copy photos from one album
to another, you can treat photos in different albums as independent of each
other, even though they may be the same actual picture. Which means the
same picture may have different tags in different albums. (A good implementation
will make sure that the user doesn't import a photo into an album when the 
same photo is already in another album, but for the purpose of this project, we
will allow it.)

</p><p><b>Q: </b>Are we allowed to use Picasso (or any other) library to display
images in our program?
<br><b>A: </b>No.
